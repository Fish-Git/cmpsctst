It is recommended that each test file be placed into its
own appropriate subdirectory. This makes it easier to select
a smaller subset of test files by simply choosing a lower
level subdirectory with fewer subdirectories/files within.

This is NOT a requirement however.

I also learned that you should also avoid using directory and/or
file names containing dollar signs as that tends to confuse the
heck out of Linux shell causing unpredictable results/failures.
The same would very likely occur with percent signs on Windows.
